# Active work

the goal is to help people understand what is happening in the app.
the app runs 50 simulations, and it calculates aggregations before and after sampling.
I need to show that in a chart.

We'll start with the P99 aggregation. It is most interesting.

The chart should be a scatter plot.

- the title is: P99 For Each Simulation, Before and After Sampling
- the x axis is simulation number, 1-50.
- the y axis is P99.
- for each simulation run, plot two points:
  - the true P99, in green
  - the sampled P99, in red
