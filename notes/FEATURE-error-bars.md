# Add error bars to the scatter plots

I want to show:

Based on the output from the simulation, I want to add error bars to the scatter plots.
First, we'll start with calculating the heights of them, top and bottom separately.

Let's start with the top.
When the green dots (true value) are above the red squares (sampled value), what value, if added to the sampled value, would include 95% of the true values?

Calculate that value and put it in the title of the plot.
