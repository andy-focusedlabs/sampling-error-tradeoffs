# things to do

- make the sliders land on round numbers
- make the default distribution 'normal'

- understand the code

- make graphs at the bottom (one per aggregation) that populates left-to-right as simulations run.
- each point on the scatterplot will represent an aggregated result for one simulation run.
  - plot both the real value, from the original generated data
  - and the value calculated from the sampled data
- then think about how to represent error bars.
